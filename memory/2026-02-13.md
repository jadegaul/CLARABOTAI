# Memory Log - 2026-02-13

## Morning Session (07:10 - 08:17 PST)

### Dashboard Major Rework
- Completely redesigned the Clara Dashboard with modern GitHub-inspired dark theme
- Added sidebar navigation with Overview, System, and Resources sections
- Created clean stats cards showing Active Tasks, In Progress, Completed, Session Uptime
- Streamlined 4-column kanban board with priority dots (red/yellow/green)
- Right-panel widgets for Notes, Activity Log, and Quick Actions
- Mobile-responsive with sidebar hiding on tablets

### Features Added
1. **Auto-Refresh Toggle** - 30-second refresh interval, saves preference to localStorage
2. **Deliverables & Docs Tab** - New view with:
   - Generated Reports panel (searchable)
   - Google Drive Quick Access (5 folder links)
   - Searchable Documents list
   - Full file table with sorting and filtering

### Assistant Scripts Created
Created 3 bash scripts in `/dashboard/scripts/` for AI agent integration:
- `assistant-log.sh` - Log actions to dashboard activity feed
- `assistant-task.sh` - Add/complete/move tasks on kanban board
- `assistant-status.sh` - Update AI status (working/idle/online)

Scripts write to `data/dashboard-sync.json` which dashboard reads every 30 seconds.

### System Updates
- Telegram messaging tested and confirmed working (user ID: 7152537300)
- Gateway restarted successfully
- Daily Google Alerts summary delivered (transgender rights news)
- Dashboard running at http://localhost:8080

### Technical Notes
- Using GitHub-style CSS variables for theming
- Dashboard uses localStorage with external data sync
- Scripts use Python3 for JSON manipulation
- Server runs via `python3 -m http.server 8080`
