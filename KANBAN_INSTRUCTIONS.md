HOW TO USE YOUR KANBAN BOARD

1. ADD TASKS TO BACKLOG
   - Drop new tasks in the Backlog status
   - Set Priority: Low | Medium | High | Urgent
   - Fill in "Assigned By" so I know who requested it

2. MOVE TASKS THROUGH STATUSES
   - Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Review → Done
   - I'll update the Status column as I work

3. BATCH WORK
   - Group similar tasks (e.g., all "calendar checks")
   - I'll tackle batches during my heartbeat checks

4. COMMUNICATION
   - Instead of texting "check my calendar" 
   - Add it to the board with status "To Do"
   - I'll see it and get to work

5. NOTES FIELD
   - Add URLs, context, special instructions
   - I reference these when working on tasks

STATUS OPTIONS:
- Backlog: Ideas and future tasks
- To Do: Ready to work on
- In Progress: Currently working
- Review: Ready for your feedback
- Done: Complete!

I'LL CHECK THIS BOARD:
- During heartbeat (every few hours)
- When you mention "check the board"
- At start of new sessions

PRO TIP: You can access this anytime at the Google Sheets link!
