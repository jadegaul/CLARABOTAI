## Compaction Recovery Protocol

If you see `<summary>` tag or context was truncated:
1. READ this file FIRST
2. Read SESSION-STATE.md  
3. Read today's + yesterday's daily notes
4. Search all sources if still missing context
5. Extract important context into SESSION-STATE.md
6. Present: "Recovered from working buffer. Last task was X. Continue?"

*Never ask "what were we discussing?" — the buffer has the conversation.*
