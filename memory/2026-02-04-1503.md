user: [Wed 2026-02-04 06:59 PST] can you check my calendar for this week
[message_id: [UUID-REDACTED]]
assistant: To check your calendar, I'll need to use the gog skill. Let me read the gog skill documentation first.


assistant: To check your calendar for this week, I'll use the `gog calendar events` command. Let me execute that.


assistant: To list events for
assistant: It looks like the `gog` command needs an account specified. Let me try again with the account information.


assistant: It seems we need to authenticate the `gog` command for your Google Calendar account first. Let's set up the authentication.

To proceed, you'll need to run these commands:
1. `gog auth credentials /path/to/your/client_secret.json`
2. `gog auth add jadegaul@gmail.com --services calendar`

Once you've completed these steps, I can try checking your calendar again.

Would you like me to guide you through obtaining the client_secret.json file?
user: [Wed 2026-02-04 07:02 PST] try now
[message_id: [UUID-REDACTED]]
assistant: It seems we still need to authenticate the `gog` command for your Google Calendar account. Since I can't directly interact with your system, I'll guide you through the process.

1. First, you need to obtain a `client_secret.json` file from the Google Cloud Console. Here's how:
   - Go to the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Create a new project or select an existing one.
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
   - Click on "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID".
   - Select "Desktop app" as the application type.
   - Download the JSON key file (this is your `client_secret.json`).

2. Once you have the `client_secret.json` file, run these commands in your terminal:
   ```bash
   gog auth credentials /path/to/your/client_secret.json
   gog auth add jadegaul@gmail.com --services calendar
   ```

After completing these steps, try checking your calendar again by running `gog calendar events --week --account=jadegaul@gmail.com` in your terminal.

If you need more help or have any issues during this process, feel free to ask!
