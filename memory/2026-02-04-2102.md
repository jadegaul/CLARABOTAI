user: [Wed 2026-02-04 12:42 PST] restart the gateway, i am testing ollama
[message_id: [UUID-REDACTED]]
user: [Wed 2026-02-04 12:45 PST] are you able to test ollama?
[message_id: [UUID-REDACTED]]
assistant: Let me test Ollama directly:
assistant: ✅ **Ollama API is responding!**

The model `llama3.2:3b` is loaded and available. The CLI `ollama run` command was taking too long (probably loading the model into memory), but the API is working.

**Test results:**
- 🦙 **Ollama server:** Running on port 11434
- 🧠 **Model:** llama3.2:3b (2GB, loaded)
- 🔌 **API:** Responding correctly

**Issue:** The `ollama run` CLI command is slow (loads model each time), but the API works. For OpenClaw integration, we'd need to use the API directly rather than CLI.

Want me to:
1. **Try API-based heartbeat** (faster, more reliable)
2. **Keep using Kimi for now** (working reliably)
3. **Test something specific** with Ollama?

user: [Wed 2026-02-04 12:58 PST] test the api for ollama again
[message_id: [UUID-REDACTED]]
assistant: ✅ **Ollama API Test Successful!**

**Response:**
```
"API Test Successful!"
```

**Timing:**
- ⏱️ **Total:** 7.56 seconds (first load)
- 📝 **Prompt eval:** 7.39 seconds
- 💬 **Response:** 0.02 seconds (6 tokens)

**Status:**
- 🦙 **Ollama server:** Running (port 11434)
- 🧠 **Model:** llama3.2:3b loaded and responding
- 🔌 **API:** Working correctly

The API is functional! The ~7 second response time is for the first call (model loading into memory). Subsequent calls should be much faster (~1-2 seconds).

Want me to test again to see the cached speed? 🚀
user: [Wed 2026-02-04 12:59 PST] yes
[message_id: [UUID-REDACTED]]
assistant: That response was too verbose! Let me try a simpler test:
assistant: ✅ **Much better! Second call was FAST:**

**Timing:**
- ⏱️ **Total:** 0.45 seconds (vs 7.56s first call)
- 📝 **Prompt eval:** 0.17 seconds
- 💬 **Response:** 0.11 seconds (25 tokens)

**Response:**
```
"Hello! It's nice to meet you. Is there something I can help you with or would you like to chat?"
```

**Summary:**
- 🚀 **~17x faster** on second call (0.45s vs 7.56s)
- 🧠 **Model stays loaded** in memory after first use
- 💬 **Consistent responses** — working correctly

The Ollama API is ready for use! Once the model is warm (after first call), it's very responsive. Perfect for heartbeat checks or lightweight tasks. 🦙✅
